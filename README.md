This is a simple ATM simulator project, created to demonstrate how an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) works when a user interacts with it. It includes basic functionalities such as PIN verification, balance checking, cash withdrawal, and deposit operations.

This project is designed from the perspective of a beginner student who is just starting to learn the fundamentals of programming. It focuses on core programming concepts such as:

Conditional statements

Loops

Functions

User input/output

Basic logic building

Purpose:

The main purpose of this project is to help beginner students understand how real-life systems like an ATM can be simulated using simple code. It provides a hands-on way to learn and apply programming logic in an engaging, real-world scenario.
